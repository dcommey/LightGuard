abstract = {Traffic Classification (TC), consisting in how to infer applications generating network traffic, is currently the enabler for valuable profiling information, other than being the workhorse for service differentiation/blocking. Further, TC is fostered by the blooming of mobile (mostly encrypted) traffic volumes, fueled by the huge adoption of hand-held devices. While researchers and network operators still rely on machine learning to pursue accurate inference, we envision Deep Learning (DL) paradigm as the stepping stone toward the design of practical (and effective) mobile traffic classifiers based on automatically-extracted features, able to operate with encrypted traffic, and reflecting complex traffic patterns. In this context, the paper contribution is fourfold. First, it provides a taxonomy of the key network traffic analysis subjects where DL is foreseen as attractive. Secondly, it delves into the non-trivial adoption of DL to mobile TC, surfacing potential gains. Thirdly, to capitalize such gains, it proposes and validates a general framework for DL-based encrypted TC. Two concrete instances originating from our framework are then experimentally evaluated on three mobile datasets of human users’ activity. Lastly, our framework is leveraged to point to future research perspectives.}

abstract = {Encrypted traffic detection and classification is a critical domain in network security, increasingly essential in an era of pervasive encryption. This survey paper delves into integrating advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to address the challenges of robust encryption methods and dynamic network behaviors. Despite notable advancements, there remains a substantial gap in the operational application of these technologies, often constrained by scalability, efficiency, and adaptability to varied encryption standards. We critically review existing methodologies from 7 surveys and 82 related technical papers, highlight the shortcomings, and propose future research directions. Our analysis underscores the need to develop innovative, resource-efficient models that seamlessly adapt to new threats and encryption techniques without compromising performance. Additionally, we advocate for creating comprehensive datasets that merge encrypted and non-encrypted traffic to enhance model training and testing. This survey maps out the trajectory of recent developments and charts a course for future research that could significantly enhance encrypted traffic management and security capabilities.}

abstract = {Classification of network traffic data into different applications, services, or types is critical for network service providers to monitor networks and maintain Quality of Service (QoS). With the continuous evolution of technological advancements and with the rapid increase in security and user privacy concerns, encryption techniques are commonly used. Encrypted network traffic makes it challenging for network service providers to monitor a network using classical network monitoring techniques and tools. Due to security and privacy reasons, data cannot be decrypted. The dynamics of encrypted network traffic data cannot be interpreted, and it makes the task of classifying the encrypted network traffic a major challenge. This presents Internet Service Providers with challenges as varying Quality of Service is being provided to clients along with the security and privacy concerns to monitor network traffic. Machine learning and deep learning techniques are being utilized to classify encrypted network traffic data. This paper presents an ensemble learning technique that is based on existing data pre-processing machine learning and deep learning techniques. We examine different models and identify the best and relevant statistical features from encrypted network traffic for the classification of non-VPN encrypted network traffic data. We performed multiple experiments that led us to developing an ensemble learning model based on the existing deep learning and machine learning models for the classification of non-VPN encrypted network traffic data. The proposed solution (named as CARD-B) is composed of Capsule Neural Networks, Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Decision Trees, along with Boosting techniques such as Adaptive Boosting and Extreme Gradient Boosting. The techniques are stacked using Random Forest Classifier. The result of the experiment shows that the proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 96% and an AUC of 98% using different possible extracted statistical features.}

abstract = {Deep learning models have shown to achieve high performance in encrypted traffic classification. However, when it comes to production use, multiple factors challenge the performance of these models. The emergence of new protocols, especially at the application layer, as well as updates to previous protocols affect the patterns in input data, making the model’s previously learned patterns obsolete. Furthermore, proposed model architectures for encrypted traffic classification are usually tested on datasets collected in controlled settings, which makes the reported performances unreliable for production use. In this paper, we study how the performances of two high-performing state-of-the-art encrypted traffic classifiers change on multiple real-world datasets collected over the course of two years from a major ISP’s network. We investigate the changes in traffic data patterns highlighting the extent to which these changes, also known as data drift, impact the performance of the two models in service-level as well as application-level classification. We propose best practices for architecture adaptations to improve the accuracy of the model in the face of data drift. We show that our best practices are generalizable to other encryption protocols and different levels of labeling granularity.}

abstract="In the realm of cybersecurity, the detection of Concept Drift holds the potential to improve the adaptability and effectiveness of security systems. In particular, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) frameworks can benefit from real-time Drift Detection, enabling prompt detection of changing attack patterns, and consequent update of the detection criteria. To explore such an opportunity, the proposed approach extends a previously introduced SIEM solution with Concept Drift Detectors. An experimental evaluation is presented using two well-known unsupervised detectors on a merged dataset featuring Concept Drift, taking into consideration metrics such as Error Rate, Precision, Recall, and Window Average Error Rate. The results demonstrate that the integrated mechanism successfully identifies Concept Drift, triggering SIEM alerts and prompting timely updates to correlation rules. The experiment's implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed, emphasizing the importance of continuous improvement in cybersecurity measures.",

This study performed VPN and non-VPN traffic analysis and developed a classification system based on the new techniques of machine learning classifiers known as stacking ensemble learning. The methods used for VPN and Non-VPN classification use three machine learning techniques: random forest, neural network, and support vector machine. To assess the proposed method's performance, we tested it on a dataset containing 61 features. The experiment results accurately prove the study's classifiers to differentiate between VPN and Non-VPN traffic. The accuracy level was approximately 99% in the training and testing phase. The study's classifiers also show the best standard deviation, with a 100% accuracy rate compared to other A.I. classifier methods.}

To tackle such issues, recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have explored matrix factorization techniques. However, these approaches encounter difficulties in preserving the global patterns of incremental data. In this paper, we propose CLDNE, a Continual Learning framework specifically designed for Dynamic Network Embedding. At the core of CLDNE lies a streaming graph auto-encoder that effectively captures both global and local patterns of the input graph. To further overcome catastrophic forgetting, CLDNE is equipped with an experience replay buffer and a knowledge distillation module, which preserve high-order historical topology and static historical patterns. We conduct experiments on four dynamic networks using link prediction and node classification tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of CLDNE. The outcomes demonstrate that CLDNE successfully mitigates the catastrophic forgetting problem and reduces training time by 80\% without a significant loss in learning new patterns.}
